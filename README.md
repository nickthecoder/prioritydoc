A new design for javadocs. This isn't about asthetics, this is about functionality.

Traditional Javadocs are just too cumbersome to use. PriorityDoc has neat features, including :

-  Shows only the most important methods, and hides the others. Show them with a single key press.
-  Skip to methods based on their initial letter with a single key press.
-  Remove clutter by hiding fully qualified names; hover over a type to see its package name.
-  Expand and contract method and field details.
-  Static fields and methods are separate from their non-static cousins.
-  Designed to be easy to scan through.
