==========

Test Generics
    Does <T extends MyClass> work, how about <? extends T>

Test all forms of "see", and all forms of {@link}

Use it to generate itchy's javadocs
    Just temporarily ad-hoc, then permanently adding PriorityDoc to the project and changing the ant build.

Publish the generated Maven "site" to /public/prioritydoc




Later
=====



Add link icons, which change the url to point to that resource.
    e.g. #myMethod()
    It may also need to set the priority.

Substitute a type variable with its actual type when subclassing. (As in ExplositionBuilder).

Make "jump to" shortcuts more complex.
    X to jump to methods beginning with X
    . f X to jump to fields beginning with X
    . s f X ... static field ...
    . s m X ... static methods
    / f     Jump to fields
    / s f   Jump to static fields
    / m     Jump to methods
    / s m   Jump to static methods

    Can I use just ONE prefix (either . or /), and rely on the timing?
      / f <PAUSE>    jump to fields
      / f X          jump to fields beginning with X
