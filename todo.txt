For See links to work, need an anchor for each method and field.
    Note, that the "initial letter" anchors need to be qualified, so they don't clash with field names.



Generate default priorites for each method based on :
    public=1 protected=3 package=4 private=5 depricated=5
    
    Super methods are capped at 3, unless otherwise stated.
      @methodpriority 1 setText foo*
      @methodpriority 2 bar get* set*
    Ditto for fieldpriority

    Inner classes have a lower priority by default.

Add a README, and gpl

==========

Test Enums
  Works, but needs retesting when priority has been implemented

Test Generics
    Does <T extends MyClass> work, how about <? extends T>

Test that classes have priority (i.e. can be hidden on the package index and index).

Test all forms of "see", and all forms of {@link}
  It currently puts the label AFTER the link, but it shouldn't.

Use it to generate itchy's javadocs
    Just temporarily ad-hoc, then permanently adding PriorityDoc to the project and changing the ant build.

Uncomment the "if" which prevents resource files from being overwritten.

Publish the generated Maven "site" to /public/prioritydoc

Later
=====
    
Add link icons, which change the url to point to that resource.
    e.g. #myMethod()
    It may also need to set the priority.

  
Substitute a type variable with its actual type when subclassing. (As in ExplositionBuilder).


Make "jump to" shortcuts more complex.
    X to jump to methods beginning with X
    . f X to jump to fields beginning with X
    . s f X ... static field ...
    . s m X ... static methods
    / f     Jump to fields
    / s f   Jump to static fields
    / m     Jump to methods
    / s m   Jump to static methods

    Can I use just ONE prefix (either . or /), and rely on the timing?
      / f <PAUSE>    jump to fields
      / f X          jump to fields beginning with X
