Test Generics
    Does <T extends MyClass> work, how about <? extends T>

Test all forms of "see", and all forms of {@link}

=====

Substitute a type variable with its actual type when subclassing. (As in ExplositionBuilder).

Make "jump to" shortcuts more complex.
    X to jump to methods beginning with X
    . f X to jump to fields beginning with X
    . s f X ... static field ...
    . s m X ... static methods
    / f     Jump to fields
    / s f   Jump to static fields
    / m     Jump to methods
    / s m   Jump to static methods

    Can I use just ONE prefix (either . or /), and rely on the timing?
      / f <PAUSE>    jump to fields
      / f X          jump to fields beginning with X
